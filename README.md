# inferno-embedded-database
Template project to provide a project configuration for supporting the file based (not in memory!) database. 
The prime idea was to have a system independent persistent engine per application, so basically it would become a standalone application. It has been possible with H2 database.

Project must be build prior to use:

mvn clean package

After a build is completed, you will find packed project files (in format tar.gz and zip). These are the main products of this project.

Here is the list of files that should be generated by the maven build:
inferno-embedded-database-${version}.jar - executable jar file
inferno-embedded-database-${version}.jar.original - original jar file
inferno-embedded-database-${version}-sources.jar - sources jar file of the project
inferno-embedded-database-paczka-linux.tar.gz - packed ready-to-use project with the required structure (for Linux)
inferno-embedded-database-paczka-windows.zip - packed ready-to-use project with the required structure (for Windows)

The directowy structure of the application:

    │   └── application.properties
    ├── database
    │   ├── import
    │   └── scripts
